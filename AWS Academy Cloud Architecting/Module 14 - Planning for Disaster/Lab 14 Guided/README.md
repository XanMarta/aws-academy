# Module 14 â€“ Guided Lab: Hybrid Storage and Data Migration with AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway
[//]: # "SKU: ILT-TF-200-ACACAD-2    Source Course: SPL-223"

## Lab overview and objectives

In this lab, you will use the AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway service to attach a Network File System (NFS) mount to an on-premises data store. You will then replicate that data to an S3 bucket in AWS. Additionally, you will configure advanced Amazon S3 features, like Amazon S3 lifecycle policies and cross-Region replication.

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Configure a File Gateway with an NFS file share and attach it to a Linux instance
- Migrate a set of data from the Linux instance to an S3 bucket
- Create and configure a primary S3 bucket to migrate on-premises server data to AWS
- Create and configure a secondary S3 bucket to use for cross-Region replication
- Create an S3 lifecycle policy to automatically manage data in a bucket

<br/>

## Duration

This lab will require approximately **90 minutes** to complete.

<br/>

## AWS service restrictions

In this lab environment, access to AWS services and service actions might be restricted to the ones that are needed to complete the lab instructions. You might encounter errors if you attempt to access other services or perform actions beyond the ones that are described in this lab.

<br/>

## Accessing the AWS Management Console

1. At the top of these instructions, choose <span id="ssb_voc_grey">Start Lab</span> to launch your lab.

   A **Start Lab** panel opens, and it displays the lab status.

   <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> **Tip**: If you need more time to complete the lab, restart the timer for the environment by choosing the <span id="ssb_voc_grey">Start Lab</span> button again.

2. Wait until the **Start Lab** panel displays the message *Lab status: ready*, then close the panel by choosing the **X**.

3. At the top of these instructions, choose <span id="ssb_voc_grey">AWS</span>.

   This action opens the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system automatically logs you in.

   <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Tip**: If a new browser tab does not open, a banner or icon is usually at the top of your browser with the message that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon, and then choose **Allow pop-ups**.

4. Arrange the **AWS Management Console** tab so that it displays alongside these instructions. Ideally, you will have both browser tabs open at the same time so that you can follow the lab steps more easily.

   <i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Do not change the Region unless specifically instructed to do so**.

<br/>

## Task 1: Reviewing the lab architecture

This lab environment uses a total of three AWS Regions. A Linux EC2 instance that emulates an on-premises server is deployed to the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) Region. The Storage Gateway virtual appliance is deployed to the same Region as the Linux server. In a real-world scenario, the appliance would be deployed in a VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V environment, or as a physical Storage Gateway appliance.

The primary S3 bucket is created in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region. Data from the Linux host is copied to the primary S3 bucket. This bucket can also be called the *source*.

The secondary S3 bucket is created in the us-west-2 (Oregon) Region. This secondary bucket is the *target* for the cross-Region replication policy. It can also be called the *destination*.

<br/>

## Task 2: Creating the primary and secondary S3 buckets

Before you configure the File Gateway, you must create the primary S3 bucket (or the source) where you will replicate the data. You will also create the secondary bucket (or the destination) that will be used for cross-Region replication.

5. In the **AWS Management Console**, on the <span id="ssb_services">Services</span> menu, select **S3**.

6. Choose <span id="ssb_orange">Create bucket</span> then configure these settings:

  - **Bucket name:** Create a name that you can remember easily. It must be globally unique.
  - **Region:** *US East (Ohio) us-east-2*
  - **Bucket Versioning:** *Enable*

   <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> For cross-Region replication, you must enable versioning for both the source and destination buckets.  

7. Choose <span id="ssb_orange">Create bucket</span>

8. Repeat the previous steps in this task to create a second bucket with the following configuration:

  - **Bucket name:** Create a name you can easily remember. It must be globally unique.
  - **Region:** *US West (Oregon) us-west-2*
  - **Versioning:** *Enable*

<br/>

## Task 3: Enabling cross-Region replication

Now that you created your two S3 buckets and enabled versioning on them, you can create a replication policy.

9. Select the name of the *source* bucket that you created in the US East (Ohio) Region.

10. Select the **Management** tab, under Replication rules select <span id="ssb_white"></i> Create replication rule</span>

11. Configure the following for **Replication rule configuration**:

  - **Replication rule name:** `crr-full-bucket`
  - **Status** *Enabled*
  - **Choose a rule scope:** *This rule applies to all objects in the bucket*
  - **Destination:**
    - <i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> *Choose a bucket in this account*
    - Click <span id="ssb_white"></i> Browse S3</span> and select the bucket you created in US West (Oregon) Region.
    - Select <span id="ssb_orange"></i> Choose path</span>
  - **IAM role:** *S3-CRR-Role* 
    - **Note:**  To find the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, in the search box, enter: `S3-CRR` (This role was pre-created with the required permissions for this lab)

12. Choose <span id="ssb_orange"></i> Save</span>

13. Return to the bucket you created in the US East (Ohio) Region.

14. Click <span id="ssb_orange"></i> Upload</span> to upload a file from your local computer to the bucket.

   *For this lab, use a small file that does not contain sensitive information, such as a blank text file.*

15. Select  <span id="ssb_white"></i> Add files</span> then click <span id="ssb_orange"></i>Upload</span> 

16. Wait for the file to upload, then return to the bucket you created in the US West (Oregon) Region. The file that you uploaded should also be copied to this bucket.

   **Note:** You may need to choose refresh <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> the console for the object to appear.

<br/>

## Task 4: Configuring the File Gateway and creating an NFS file share

In this task, you will deploy the File Gateway appliance as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. You will then configure a cache disk, select an S3 bucket to synchronize your on-premises files to, and select an IAM policy to use. Finally, you will create an NFS file share on the File Gateway.

17. At the top-left, choose the <span id="ssb_services">Services</span> menu, then select **Storage Gateway**.

   You can also search for *Storage Gateway* from the top of the **Services** menu to make locating it easier.

18. At the top-right of the console, verify that the current Region is *N. Virginia*.

19. Choose <span id="ssb_orange"></i> Create gateway</span>

20. Select **Amazon S3 File gateway**, then choose <span id="ssb_orange"></i> Next</span>

21. Select **Amazon EC2**, then choose the <span id="ssb_white"></i> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> Launch instance</span> button.

   A new tab opens to the EC2 instance launch wizard. This link automatically selects the correct Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that must be used for the File Gateway appliance.

22. Select the **t2.xlarge** instance type, then choose <span id="ssb_grey"></i> Next: Configure Instance Details</span>

   **Note:** t2.xlarge is the only instance type that you can select in this lab environment. If you select any other instance type, it will result in an error message at the end of the wizard.

   * Select the instance that you want to connect to
   * In the **Description** tab, copy the **IPv4 Public IP** value


   ```bash
    ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
   ```

77. When you are prompted to allow the first connection to this remote SSH server, enter `yes`.

    Because you are using a key pair for authentication, you are not prompted for a password.

<a id='ssh-after'></a>

<br/>

#### You should now be connected to the instance.

78. On the Linux instance, to view the data that exists on this server, enter the following command:

   `ls /media/data`

   You should see 20 image files in the .png format.

79. Create the directory that will be used to synchronize data with your S3 bucket by using the following command:

   `sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/s3`

80. Mount the file share on the Linux instance by using the command that you copied at the end of the last task.

  ```bash
  sudo mount -t nfs -o nolock,hard <File-Gateway-appliance-private-IP-address>:/<S3-bucket-name> /mnt/nfs/s3
  ```

	For example:

  ```bash
  sudo mount -t nfs -o nolock,hard 10.10.1.33:/lab-nfs-bucket /mnt/nfs/s3
  ```

81. Verify that the share was mounted correctly by entering the following command:

	`df -h`

	The output of the command should be similar to the following example:

  ```pseudocode
  [ec2-user@ip-10-10-1-210 ~]$ df -h
  Filesystem                  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  devtmpfs                    483M   64K  483M   1% /dev
  tmpfs                       493M     0  493M   0% /dev/shm
  /dev/xvda1                  7.8G  1.1G  6.6G  14% /
  10.10.1.33:/lab-nfs-bucket  8.0E     0  8.0E   0% /mnt/nfs/s3
  ```

82. Now that you created the mount point, you can copy the data that you want to migrate to Amazon S3 into the share by using this command:

   `cp -v /media/data/*.png /mnt/nfs/s3`


<br/>

## Task 6: Verifying that the data is migrated

You have finished configuring the gateway and copying data into the NFS share. Now, you will verify that the configuration works as intended.

83. Choose the <span id="ssb_services">Services</span> menu and select **S3**.

84. Select the bucket that you created in the US East (Ohio) Region, and verify that the 20 image files are listed.

   **Note:** You might need to choose the refresh <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> in the AWS console.

85. Return to the S3 buckets page and select the bucket that you created in the US West (Oregon) Region. Verify that the images files replicated to this bucket, based on the policy that you created earlier.

   **Note:** S3 Object replication can take up to 15 minutes to complete. Keep refreshing until you see the replicated objects. 

<br/>

You successfully migrated data to Amazon S3 by using AWS Storage Gateway in File Gateway mode! After your data is stored in Amazon S3, you can act on it like native Amazon S3 data. In this lab, you created a replication policy to copy the data to a secondary Region. You could also perform other operations, such as configuring a lifecycle policy. For example, you could migrate infrequently used data automatically from S3 Standard to Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier for long-term storage, which can reduce costs.
